                    and computer science but I'm aslo avid reader of
                    fiction. Eventually, I hope to get a job in the

                    <p> Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪じゅ術じゅつ師し Jujutsushi?) are individuals 
                        secretly trained and employed by the government in Japan to defend
                        humanity from cursed spirits. The race of humans capable of using 
                        jujutsu are colloquially known as Sorcerers (術じゅつ師し), and the 
                        jujutsu prefix is often used to signify their alignment to Jujutsu
                        High. Jujutsu sorcerers who use their powers for criminal purposes,
                        such as murder, are called Curse Users (呪じゅ詛そ師し) while humans 
                        who cannot use jujutsu are called Non-Sorcerers (非ひ術じゅつ師).</p>

                    <p> The story of Jujutsu Kaisen is set in a world where Cursed Spirits
                        feed on unsuspecting humans and fragments of the legendary and feared
                        demon Ryomen Sukuna have been lost and scattered about.Should any 
                        curse consume Sukuna's body parts, the power they gain could destroy 
                        the world as we know it. Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school
                        of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious existence of
                        the living from the supernatural! Read More</p>

                <h2>Did you know that ... </h2>
                <p> A lot of people these days don't know that Jujutsu Kaisen 0,
                    the story arc starring Yuta Okkotsu as the protagonist, was 
                    originally a one-shot published in 2017. Author Gege Akutami
                    didn't have a clear idea of the story and just wanted to draw 
                    and write something he thought was cool, with this one-shot 
                    being the end result.This is why Yuta is the protagonist and 
                    not Yuji Itadori, and this is why elements such as Satoru Gojo's 
                    strength and Suguru Geto's characterization are a bit inconsistent 
                    with what was shown in the main story of the manga. Akutami thought 
                    to make it non-canon but ultimately chose to use it, adding 
                    the vast majority of these characters to the main series.</p>
